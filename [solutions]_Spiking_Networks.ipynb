        "Transmission of spiking activity from one cell to another generally procedes like this: (1) Spikes originate close to the cell's soma (axon hillock) via Sodium channel positive feedback, (2) propagate through axons, (3) activate pre-synapses to release neurotransmitters, which are (4) taken up by receptors of the post-synaptic cell, which (5)  activate conductances that (6) become current fluxes into the post-synaptic cell. These current fluxes can be inward and thus excitatory (+, e.g. NMDA/AMPA) or outward, and thus inhibitory (-, e.g., GABA, Glycine). Sufficient current leads to a postsynaptic action potential. And this process propagates to all connected neurons in a network.\n",

Given the 50Hz rate, $p = 0.05$ -- spikes/milisecond).

We can plot the spikes over time as dots in a raster plot, where each row in the y-axis display spikes from a single neuron (or a trial). The **raster plot** gives us an idea of the regularity and temporal patterning of the spikes. If we are interested in spike counts over time, we can use a **spike count histogram** which accumulates spikes in a bin of a given duration. The histogram gives us a sense of the average firing rate (in Hz or in spikes per bin) of the entire network. We can read out the average rate of the neurons by (mentally) dividing the spike count in a single bar by the bin duration and the number of neurons in the network.\n",

        "The input we used in this case was stochastic, represented by random spikes. In an important sense this type of input embodies the least possible number of assumptions about the input, and provides a sense of entire class of possible network behaviors for a given input intensity. However, in the nervous system there is much more structure in input patterns to the network, due to sensory input and specific feedbacks through the environment. When the stimuli to the network are specific, we may be able to extract them from spike trains, thus decoding the neural activity. Encoding and decoding of stimuli are in fact the next step in our exploration of spiking neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Random Connectivity\n",
        "Even though we had two different populations the connectivity across them was random. To what extent are brain networks well represented by random connections? This is certainly a very interesting discussion, but the short version of it is that \"as a first approximation it gives us plenty of insights about actual brain data\". However, here we were looking mostly into the dynamics of the network. When we start discussing 'encoding and decoding', we will start to see we can start interpreting network structure in the context of behaviors."
